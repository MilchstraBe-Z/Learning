    <h1>Chickens</h1>

    <p>The <b>chicken (Gallus domesticus)</b> is a large and round short-winged <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird">bird</a> , domesticated from the red
        junglefowl of Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs;
        others are kept as pets or for cockfighting. </p>


    <p>Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, and an
        annual production of more than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. There
        are numerous cultural references to chickens in folklore, religion, and literature. </p>

    <p>Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are unfeathered in most breeds,
        and the wings are short.[18] Wild junglefowl can fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to allow
        them to fly more than a short distance.[19] Size and coloration vary widely between breeds.[18] Adult chickens
        of both sexes have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin on either
        side under their beaks called wattles; combs and wattles are more prominent in males. Some breeds have a
        mutation that causes extra feathering under the face, giving the appearance of a beard.[20]</p>

    <h3>heading 3</h3>

    <p>Chickens are omnivores.[21] In the wild, they scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and animals as
        large as lizards, small snakes,[22] and young mice.[23] A chicken may live for 5â€“10 years, depending on the
        breed.[24] The world's oldest known chicken lived for 16 years.[25]</p>
